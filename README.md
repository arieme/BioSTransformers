# BioSTransformers: New Siamese Neural Networks for Zero-Shot Learning in Biomedical Texts
This repository provides a new siamese neural models (sentence transformers) trained on biomedical data. These models can be used in several NLP tasks like Document classification, Question Answering etc.


Here is a corpus that was built from the PubMed/MEDLINE database. This corpus consists of pairs (title, mesh) and (summary, mesh). the corpus contains about 6 million pairs.
